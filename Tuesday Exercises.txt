I would suggest using functions for all these, to better structure your code.

## Prime numbers.
1. a. Printout the first 100 primes.
   b. Printout every tenth prime of the first 1000 primes.
   
## Simple Bitwise.
2. a. Print an unsinged char as its binary representation.
   b. Print the binary representation of a number up to 64bits.
   Need to know how big the number is in bytes for B. sizeof() helps.

## Reversing
3. a. Reverse a string with a maximum of 213 letters.
   b. Reverse the bit order of unsinged char. ie 1000 0000 -> 0000 0001

## Sorting
4. Sort an array of unsigned ints. Make two functions, one Ascending, one Descending.
   To get you started: sorting.c
